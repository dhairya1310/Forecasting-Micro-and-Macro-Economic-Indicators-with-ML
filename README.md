# Forecasting-Micro-and-Macro-Economic-Indicators-with-ML
Forecasting GDP, inflation, consumer demand, and stock price trends using ML

# 📊 Forecasting Economic and Stock Market Trends Using Machine Learning & Deep Learning

This project combines classical machine learning models and deep learning techniques to forecast macroeconomic indicators (GDP, inflation, consumer demand) and stock price movements. Algorithms used include Linear & Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, RNNs, and LSTM.

## 🔍 Problem Statement
Forecasting key economic and financial trends is crucial for policymakers, investors, and businesses. This project leverages supervised ML and sequence-based deep learning to uncover patterns and make forward-looking predictions using real-world data.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- TensorFlow, Keras
- Models:  
  - Linear Regression  
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Decision Tree  
  - Random Forest  
  - Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)  
  - Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

## 📁 Data Sources
- Macroeconomic data: GDP, inflation rate, consumer spending (from public economic databases)  
- Stock data: Daily closing prices and volume of selected companies

## 📊 Key Features
- Preprocessed and normalized mixed-type datasets  
- Applied both ML and DL models for comparative performance analysis  
- Evaluated results using MAE, RMSE, Accuracy, and classification metrics  
- Visualized trend predictions and model outputs

## ✅ Outcomes
The Random Forest and LSTM models achieved strong accuracy for GDP and stock trend forecasting. RNNs performed well on sequential financial data, while classical models offered interpretability for policy-related indicators.
